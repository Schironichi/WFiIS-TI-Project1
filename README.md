# WFiIS-TI-Project1

Ohm's Law web simulation using HTML5 with CSS styles + JavaScript 

The project is based on Walter Fendt's [Ohm's Law App](https://www.walter-fendt.de/html5/phen/ohmslaw_en.htm). All relevant files have a short commentary in Polish above each of the elements. All functions and names of variables in Polish were required by the course coordinator.

The presentation of the application is available [here](https://ti-proj01-dr.mybluemix.net/static/index.html) \[ 09.02.2022 \].

The *manifest.yml* allows to build this project on IBM Cloud. The only requirement is adding the application name and calling

    ibmcloud app push

command in the system console.
